1
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:07,297
(music playing)

2
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,300
(cooing)

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,095
Can we hear it again? Please.

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,723
More-- tell us the story more!
Please.

5
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,725
(laughs)
Okay, one more time

6
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,144
and then it's off to bed.

7
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:24,231
And there came
a day unlike any other

8
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:27,443
when Earth's mightiest
heroes were united

9
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,194
against a common threat--

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,613
the soldier, the god,

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,991
the knight, the spy,

12
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,285
the giant, the king,

13
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,413
the pixie, the ghost,

14
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,623
and the archer.

15
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,834
On that day,

16
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,919
the Avengers were born,

17
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,089
to fight foes that no single hero
could withstand.

18
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,425
Time-traveling conquerors,

19
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,887
alien invaders
and masters of evil--

20
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,389
the Avengers vanquished them all

21
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,059
and finally,
when the world was at peace,

22
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,144
the heroes built lives
of their own.

23
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:06,356
The soldier and spy
fell in love,

24
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,692
as did the giant
and the pixie.

25
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,487
The king found his queen.

26
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,198
And the thunder god
returned to his kingdom

27
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,409
far away
from the world of men.

28
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,369
And one by one the children

29
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,456
- of the Avengers came to be--
- (clamoring)

30
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,750
--children who would one day

31
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:28,295
become a new generation
of heroes.

32
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,007
But in time evil returned,

33
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:35,010
an evil called Ultron.

34
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,471
Ultron wanted nothing less

35
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:41,016
than total dominion
over the world.

36
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,143
But the Avengers
stood in its way.

37
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:48,023
Sadly, their defeat
was inevitable.

38
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,072
But before they fell,

39
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:58,867
the Avengers hid their children
in a faraway place

40
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:02,913
where they would grow up safe
from Ultron's grasp,

41
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,790
because the Avengers knew

42
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,501
that as long
as the children were alive,

43
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:11,964
there was hope,
hope for the future.

44
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,982
- (zapping)
- Aagh!

45
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,488
(gasps)

46
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,205
- Tag, Pym.
- No fair, Azari.

47
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,415
You didn't give me
enough of a head start!

48
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,000
No fair?

49
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,961
Aren't you the one
who called no powers

50
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,087
then shrunk
and flew away?

51
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,006
Yeah, well,
I meant no powers for you.

52
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,968
Of course.
Guess what, Pym?

53
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,177
You're it.

54
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,263
Hey, not so fast!

55
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,973
And no powers!

56
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,527
Jocasta,
adjust environmental controls

57
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,112
in the hangar plus 2 therms.

58
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,614
Radar array 7
needs realigning

59
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,408
and let's get lunch started,
shall we?

60
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,369
Jocasta:
Commands in progress.

61
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,289
I dreamt of Asgard again, Father.

62
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,583
The Bifrost Bridge
stretched out to me

63
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:57,004
and I could see the glow
of the realm eternal.

64
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,757
I know thee
to be real, Father,

65
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,177
and hope that one day soon
you will come for your daughter.

66
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,772
(grunting)

67
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,820
And Father,
lastly I beseech thee:

68
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:25,240
give me the power
to smite Pym once and for all!

69
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,950
What?

70
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:35,792
(blade clangs)

71
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,129
Aagh!

72
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,674
That's not how
tag works, Torunn.

73
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,427
You're supposed to run
from Pym, not attack us.

74
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,262
That's a human rule.

75
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:52,017
An immortal Asgardian warrior
runs from no one!

76
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,518
You, Pym, and James,

77
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,937
are about to taste
my sword's wrath!

78
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,526
Hey-- I mean forsooth!

79
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,278
Where's James?

80
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,287
(snoring)

81
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,964
(groaning)

82
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,970
Does he get the sword,
the spark, or the sting today?

83
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,264
It's His Royal Highness's turn.

84
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,974
I hate you, Pym.

85
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,143
Hah.

86
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,569
- (James screams)
- (shield clanks)

87
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,279
(grunts)

88
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,323
(shield humming)

89
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,368
(humming stops)

90
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,995
(grumbling)

91
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,206
If you dorks are
all done bothering me now,

92
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,749
I'm going back to bed.

93
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,167
But you're missing the game.

94
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,379
What is your problem, James?

95
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,881
You've been sleeping all day,
missing training,

96
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,135
blowing off your chores,
and generally being a real pain.

97
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,594
Who cares?

98
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,096
What, am I gonna
miss laundry day?

99
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,223
So what if we don't
do the chores and train?

100
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:19,438
For what? Seriously,
nothing's ever gonna happen in this place.

101
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,941
You can act like a king,
Pym can play superhero,

102
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,609
and Torunn can live
in a fantasy land,

103
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,945
saying "aye" and "verily"
till she's blue in the face!

104
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,447
What's the point?

105
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,032
The point is
to not be such a jerk!

106
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,951
Oh, right, sorry.

107
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,537
There's no point for us
'cause our parents are dead.

108
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,874
Your dad just abandoned you,
so there's still hope.

109
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,168
- (war cry)
- (metal clangs)

110
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,961
(both grunting)

111
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,800
Do you think Asgardians
really say "jerk"?

112
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,635
- I don't know.
- Torunn: Yah!

113
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,346
Your magic sword
doesn't scare me, Torunn.

114
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,099
Then allow me to put
the fear of it into thee!

115
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,851
Man:
That's enough.

116
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,899
Tony! I was about to
tell them to break it up.

117
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,319
James, Torunn,
go to your bungalows and cool off.

118
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,241
Hah hah!

119
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,577
You and Azari too, Pym.

120
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,912
Aww!

121
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,087
James, wait.

122
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,925
I know you feel trapped here
with just the five of us,

123
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,344
but try not to take it out
on your brothers and sister.

124
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,722
If you want to be mad
at someone, be mad at me.

125
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,850
I'll apologize to 'em later.

126
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,853
Your father was never very good
at doing nothing, either.

127
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,939
You know you can always
come talk to me, James.

128
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,274
But it's not the same, is it?

129
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,819
Like you say,
you're not my dad.

130
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,950
(sighs)

131
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,954
- (klaxon blaring)
- (siren whooping)

132
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,455
James, go to your room!

133
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,790
Tony?

134
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,627
What's going on?
What are these lights,

135
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,128
and that noise?

136
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,173
Everyone inside James's bungalow
until I give the all clear!

137
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,508
Now!

138
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,885
(whooping continues)

139
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:41,955
(splats)

140
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,421
How do you
live like this, James?

141
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,798
Haven't you ever heard
of cleaning up?

142
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,179
We should be out there
with Tony, not hiding!

143
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,516
Maybe this is a new
training drill. Maybe--

144
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,351
(gasps)

145
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,020
(whispering)
maybe it's Ultron.

146
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,771
What?

147
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,441
That's ridiculous.
It's not Ultron.

148
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,109
It's probably
something stupid

149
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,028
like a fire
on the machine level

150
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,196
or that time
Jocasta went nuts

151
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,990
because of
the water-main leak.

152
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,034
It's not Ultron.

153
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:23,038
Yeah, you're right.
There's no way it's--

154
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,006
Hello, children.

155
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,222
Vision!

156
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,018
My apologies. The drones
in Ultra City have been upgraded.

157
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,021
One was able to damage
my immaterial form as I left.

158
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,731
Were you followed?

159
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,234
Negative.
Did I set off the alarms?

160
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,987
Perhaps my electronic
access keys were damaged.

161
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,032
And how odd. This doesn't look
like the control center.

162
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,909
Everything's
going to be all right.

163
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,953
Come on, let's get you
to the workshop.

164
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,497
Stay here.

165
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,749
(screams)

166
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,795
Tony?

167
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,297
I know you have questions.

168
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:18,218
I promise I will explain
everything, but later.

169
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,261
Right now I have to
take care of my friend.

170
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,390
Please stay in your rooms.

171
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,927
We're gonna
follow him, right?

172
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,179
- Yeah.
- Aye.

173
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,725
No. No. Absolutely not.

174
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,185
Tony said wait,
so we'll wait.

175
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,104
He'll explain everything.

176
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,690
We need to
respect his wishes.

177
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,707
Awww.

178
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,209
Pym, you're the tech-head.
Open it up.

179
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:43,011
Did you guys know that
the fountain was a secret door?

180
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,514
Because I didn't,
and I'm way smarter than all of you.

181
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,655
How could we have lived here
all this time and not known about this?

182
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,662
Pym:
Come on!

183
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,541
Guys, we're gonna
get in so much trouble.

184
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,335
Wah wah wah.

185
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,591
I think I've been here before,

186
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,760
when I was a kid.

187
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,931
I remember holding
onto this rail.

188
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,974
I was falling. I--

189
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,851
I remember being scared.

190
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,438
Ha ha. That sounds like you,
big old scaredy-- ow!

191
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,291
What is this?

192
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,961
These are our parents.

193
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,089
He's right.
It's just like the story.

194
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,342
That's my dad, Giant Man!

195
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,928
That's James's dad, the Soldier,

196
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,097
and his mom, the Black Widow!

197
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,016
And Azari's cat-dad, the King!

198
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,102
There's Torunn's dad.

199
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,357
Wait. Maybe that's her mom.

200
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,942
Look at all that hair!

201
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,944
Huh.

202
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,948
(yelps)

203
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,827
Who's that?

204
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,959
The archer, maybe?

205
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,963
But the pixie is missing,
and the knight.

206
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,383
Guys, Tony called
that robot "the Vision,"

207
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,968
The Vision is the ghost!

208
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,563
Why would Tony
keep this from us?

209
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,398
We shouldn't be in here.

210
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,984
If he wanted us to know
about these, he'd tell us.

211
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,486
We should keep going
if we're going to spy on him--

212
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,654
find him, I mean.

213
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,743
Wait for me!

214
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,833
James, come on.

215
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,923
James.

216
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,435
Tony:
Just relax, old friend.

217
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,979
I need to see
how extensive the damage is.

218
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,026
How did they find you?

219
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,195
Vision:
I was accessing the mainframe.

220
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,032
Eww, robot guts.

221
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,868
All of Europe has
now been subjugated

222
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,245
by machine forces
since my last report.

223
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,999
Drones are gathering along
the Pacific Rim and Eastern Europe.

224
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,754
The invasion of Asia
will soon commence.

225
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,928
In 13 years,
he's conquered half the planet.

226
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,682
Also, Clint Barton's son is alive.

227
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,935
- What?
- Hey, who's Clint Barton?

228
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,896
- Maybe he was the knight, or the pixie.
- (smacks head)

229
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,273
- Ow!
- The pixie was your mom, idiot.

230
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,900
Maybe he was the knight.

231
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,200
James, we should go.

232
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,744
What if it has my dad's voice,

233
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,205
or if it's programmed
to be like him,

234
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,790
or has his memories?

235
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,042
Do you think
he can hear me?

236
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,971
Um, Dad, can you hear me?

237
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,432
Hello? Are you awake?

238
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,225
James, it's not your dad.

239
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,144
It's a robot.

240
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,149
Sir? Captain America?

241
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,944
Are, uh, are you, um--
online?

242
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,654
(power surges)

243
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,739
(gasps)

244
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:16,409
Iron Avenger, designation:
Captain America,

245
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,744
now online.

246
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,079
Accessing mission database.

247
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,415
Mission acquired.

248
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,379
Destruction of Al threat.
Designation: Ultron. Commencing.

249
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,298
Ultron?

250
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,969
Iron Avengers, assemble!

251
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,731
Whoah, wait!

252
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,316
(thud)

253
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:52,987
Stop!

254
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,914
Uh, stand down!

255
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,917
Stop! Dad!

256
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,918
(yells)

257
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,770
(warning horn beeping)

258
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,321
(yells)
Thanks.

259
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:43,871
Azari, Pym, what are
you two doing down here?

260
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,663
Jocasta: Iron Avengers
launch sequence initiated.

261
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,252
Oh, no.

262
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,509
- Oops.
- Verily.

263
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,939
Computer voice:
Energy source detection.

264
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,943
Location: Arctic Circle.

265
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,112
(overlapping transmissions)

266
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,949
Energy analysis matches
fugitive designation:

267
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,121
Iron Man.

268
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,960
Finally.

269
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,970
(keyboard clacking)

270
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:26,474
Jocasta, send reserve power
to long-range radar.

271
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,392
Tony, this was
not my idea. It was--

272
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,144
Boys, grab Vision's head.

273
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,816
Hello, Henry.
Hello, Azari.

274
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:36,901
His head?

275
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,569
Boys, now!

276
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,830
Awesome!

277
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,667
Jocasta:
Multiple radar contacts.

278
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:57,004
Designation: Iron Avengers.

279
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,840
What's going on?

280
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,469
Jocasta: New contact.
Suborbital trajectory.

281
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,186
- Jocasta: Designation...
- James: Tony!

282
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,941
I'm sorry.
There were these robots

283
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,819
and they looked just like
our parents. And then--

284
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,410
I think he knows.

285
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,996
(radar beeping)

286
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,078
We're leaving.

287
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,204
What do you mean?

288
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,041
Leaving, as in leaving here?

289
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,960
But we've never left here.

290
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,964
(sighs)

291
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,979
Get to the control center!

292
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,981
We don't have much time.

293
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,024
Vision will explain.

294
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,818
Vision? What about you?

295
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,696
Jocasta:
Alert: Iron Widow offline.

296
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,074
You have to get
to the control center!

297
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,290
Jocasta:
Iron Thor offline.

298
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,000
We shouldn't
have left him!

299
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,627
He told us to!

300
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,630
We have to get to the control center.
That's what he said.

301
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,591
Jocasta:
Iron Panther offline.

302
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,636
Those robots,
the Iron Avengers,

303
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,679
why are they going offline?

304
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,766
The enemy has developed
the ability to infect machinery,

305
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,103
corrupting and overriding
its programming with its own.

306
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:20,981
There is a high probability that the
Iron Avengers have been compromised.

307
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:24,110
Jocasta:
Iron Captain America offline.

308
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,070
Vision:
He was the last of them.

309
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,989
Ultron will be
coming for us now.

310
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,284
Wait wait wait.
Wait. Ultron, really?

311
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,578
Ultron is coming? Here?

312
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,832
(deep rumble)

313
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,350
Huh?

314
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,835
(thrusters whining)

315
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,971
Children. Unexpected.

316
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,516
Assessment: potential threats.

317
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,810
Commencing termination.

318
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,418
The knight, Iron Man!

319
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,254
Get to the control center!
I'll hold it off.

320
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,547
Tony?

321
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:12,218
(thrusters rumbling)

322
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,929
I'll be right
behind you. Go!

323
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,558
This is wrong.
We have to help him!

324
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,936
Children,
do as Iron Man says.

325
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,938
You must protect the others, Torunn.

326
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,898
Your safety is
of utmost importance.

327
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,942
Iron Man will
join you shortly.

328
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,947
(siren whooping)

329
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,830
Stay, robot head.
We'll be right back.

330
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,960
Vision override.
Command code: Quinjet.

331
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,171
What? What's a quinjet?

332
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,841
- Torunn: James--
- Vision: Take your seats, please.

333
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,968
We are launching.

334
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,177
Azari:
Launching?

335
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,807
(grunting, straining)

336
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,149
No! No! Stop! Go back!

337
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,532
Whoa.

338
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,291
Struggling until the end.

339
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,045
Illogical.

340
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,422
You must realize

341
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,424
the end is here.

342
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,427
No. Still hope.

343
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,931
False. Hope is
a human delusion.

344
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,558
(thrusters rumbling)

345
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,954
Your Iron Avengers are
under my control now, Iron Man,

346
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:31,834
and you belong to me.

347
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,336
(Tony groaning)

348
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,426
Pym:
It's got Tony!

349
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,094
Look! They're taking him!

350
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,513
Stupid robot!
Do as we say!

351
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,807
Turn this ship
around now!

352
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:50,310
I will not. Iron Man sacrificed himself
to keep you safe,

353
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,979
and that is
what we will do:

354
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,981
stay safe, stay hidden.

355
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,859
There are parts of the world
where Ultron has not reached,

356
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,986
far away from Ultra City.

357
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,029
I have set a course
for the Savage Land.

358
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,907
- The Savage Land?
- That sounds horrible.

359
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:07,494
Parts of it are quite nice,
and you'll--

360
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:11,123
(beep)
Alert. Reserve power depleted.

361
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,083
Recharge re--

362
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,378
Sir?

363
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,298
He's out of juice.

364
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,925
That's just great!
What now?

365
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,178
I think I can get him
up and running.

366
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,263
I'll need to reconfigure
his power matrix.

367
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,598
I say thee nay!

368
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,601
I will not run and I will not hide.

369
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,436
I am the daughter of Thor

370
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,521
and Ultron will pay
for what he's done.

371
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,190
But Tony wanted us safe.

372
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,276
Going after Ultron
is the exact opposite of that.

373
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,737
James, back me up.

374
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,030
James?

375
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,783
Torunn:
James?

376
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,285
I led Ultron to our home.

377
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:51,497
Tony's gone because of me.

378
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,041
No! We're going after Ultron.

379
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,919
Pym, take the controls
and head for this Ultra City.

380
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:00,214
I'm on it, Torunn!
Uh, two questions:

381
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,592
How do you fly this thing
and where is Ultra City?

382
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:35,082
Okay, fine.
So, maybe they would have attacked us.

383
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,310
Big.

384
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,729
Hereth be the plan--

385
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,315
I don't think "hereth" is right.

386
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,775
Shut up, Pym.

387
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,278
Here's the plan:
we fight our way through the city,

388
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:07,364
get to Ultron,
smite him, free Tony.

389
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:10,117
That plan is insane
on several levels.

390
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,618
We can't beat Ultron.

391
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,121
I am immortal
and invulnerable.

392
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,248
Ultron holds no fear for me.

393
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,959
Besides, my father
watches over me.

394
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,461
You don't know
that you're invulnerable.

395
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,046
For Asgard!

396
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,965
(war cry)

397
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,302
Tell me she didn't
just do that.

398
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,850
Torunn!

399
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:41,899
Have at thee!

400
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,998
Ow.

401
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,625
Huh?

402
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,418
- (Torunn yells)
- No!

403
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,716
And there's more
where that came from!

404
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,176
Hah! Missed!

405
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,989
(moaning)

406
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,451
(gasps, screams)

407
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,999
We have to help her!
We have to--

408
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,047
(screams)

409
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,799
Azari!

410
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:52,886
(yells)

411
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,558
Father! Father!

412
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,025
You ready to get out
of here, beautiful?

413
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,778
I-- I mean--

414
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,947
yes.

415
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,198
Then hang on.

416
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:21,873
No!

417
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:47,315
Ultron: Even your mere existence
causes chaos, Avenger.

418
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,528
But soon there
will be order.

419
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,947
(coughs)

420
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,993
These children
you have kept hidden,

421
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,661
they will be found.

422
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,956
The kids are gone, machine,

423
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,083
far way from you.

424
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,251
False!

425
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:09,671
Like all humans,
they are inherently illogical.

426
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,840
What are you talking about?

427
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,467
Observe.

428
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,973
No!

429
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:23,185
You will now tell me everything
you know about them

430
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:27,981
or you will learn the upper limits
of the human capacity for pain.

431
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,654
James!

432
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,156
James, wake up!

433
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,575
What happened?

434
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,993
Where's Torunn?

435
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:43,330
Actually, where are we?

436
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,792
I don't know, but it's filthy.

437
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,546
(yells)

438
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,552
Robot people!
This is bad.

439
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,012
This is really bad.

440
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,722
Mr. Vision, wake up!

441
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,015
We need a hand here!

442
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,935
Do you shoot lasers
out of your eyes or anything?

443
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,438
Hey! Quit messing around.

444
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,482
- We've gotta keep moving.
- Torunn!

445
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,364
You're alive!

446
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,950
Are you all right?

447
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,952
What happened?

448
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,829
I wasn't strong enough.

449
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,831
I lost my sword,

450
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,708
and-- and my father
didn't come for me.

451
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,795
We have to go. Ultron is wired
into every one of his machines.

452
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,965
We get spotted, we're toast.

453
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,812
So, quick question:
who are you?

454
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:52,357
The name's Barton,
but everyone calls me Hawkeye.

455
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,985
Hawkeye the archer?

456
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,653
Wait a minute. Barton?

457
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,072
Do you know a guy
named Clint Barton?

458
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,700
Okay, kid.
How do you know my dad?

459
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:04,744
Kid? You're like
a day older than us.

460
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,207
We think your dad was
an Avenger like our parents.

461
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,084
Like your parents?

462
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,919
Your parents were Avengers?

463
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,546
That's not possible.

464
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,756
My dad said I was the last!

465
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,925
He told me
I'd be the last Avenger!

466
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,929
I've been here fighting
all this time.

467
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,599
- Where have you been?
- Let him go! We didn't know.

468
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,942
I thought I was the last one.

469
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:47,787
My father brought people to
the underground after Ultron took over.

470
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,956
He taught them how to survive.

471
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,584
We live under Ultron's rule,

472
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,128
keeping out of sight,
hiding in the cracks.

473
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,256
But the machines
finally got my dad.

474
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,300
Now I lead the scavengers.

475
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,303
I keep them moving,
I keep them safe.

476
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,931
Awesome!
You can help us rescue Tony.

477
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:09,309
- Who's Tony?
- Your dad wasn't the last Avenger.

478
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,479
Tony was. You know,
the knight, Iron Man?

479
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,023
He got captured by Ultron,
and we're going to rescue him.

480
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,651
(laughs)
Yeah, right!

481
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,654
I'm sorry, kid.
Ultron doesn't keep prisoners.

482
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,949
Iron Man or not,
this guy Tony is dust.

483
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,326
Woman: No.

484
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,412
He's alive.

485
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:33,166
If Tony was captured,
Ultron has him in the Citadel.

486
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,168
- Tony's alive?
- Really?

487
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,338
Don't even listen to her.
She's crazy.

488
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,341
No. If there's a chance
he's alive, we're going after him.

489
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,635
We're going to this Citadel.

490
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,014
We could use a hand.

491
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,269
I've got better things to do
than get disintegrated.

492
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,813
Did your father
give up this easily?

493
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,525
If you bring up my father
one more time,

494
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,026
I will punch you in the face.

495
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,992
Fine! Your funeral.

496
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,535
I'll show you how
to get there.

497
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,204
After that,
you're on your own.

498
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,092
Are you sure
you don't want to come?

499
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,136
You can shoot arrows at Ultron!

500
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,139
It'll be fun. Come on.

501
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,391
Stay safe, beautiful.

502
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,437
You too.

503
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,406
We'll be back for Vision's head.

504
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,241
Take good care of him.

505
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:58,877
What?

506
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,004
We have to
look after ourselves.

507
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,145
All clear.

508
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,397
Pym, Azari, come on.

509
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:37,624
James: The tower, it's heading
for the Citadel. Come on!

510
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:47,884
James: Hawkeye said the entrance
was at the top of the tower.

511
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,968
Pym:
I'll race ya!

512
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,472
We're not gonna make it!

513
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,319
Pym:
Was getting crushed part of the plan?

514
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,698
(all screaming)

515
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,703
Great! Now what?

516
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,539
James:
See what you can do about that door.

517
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,665
Pym:
I'm on it!

518
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,213
Hey, Azari can open this!

519
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:28,007
What? How do you know?

520
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:31,010
Pym: It's just like
the maintenance hatches at home.

521
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,015
Azari, you go first.

522
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:46,734
(yells)

523
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,406
Huh?

524
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,828
(moans, yelling)

525
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,206
Help!

526
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,708
Pym!

527
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,878
Just kidding.

528
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,339
We shouldn't be here.

529
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,674
James, what if--

530
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:13,636
It's going to be okay,
I promise.

531
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:24,063
Okay, there's no one here.

532
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,317
Maybe Ultron assumes no one
would be dumb enough to break in.

533
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,776
Hah! We showed him.

534
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,111
We are dumb enough.

535
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,004
James, wait!

536
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,690
Pym:
What is all this?

537
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,950
Oh, no. James.

538
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:02,954
It's like some kind
of trophy room.

539
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,164
That means--

540
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,959
Come on. Let's go.

541
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,132
(James grunts)

542
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,177
Azari:
Tony!

543
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,014
We got you, Tony!

544
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,266
Please, please tell me

545
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,560
you didn't just
walk into Ultron's trap.

546
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:28,021
How do you know it's a trap?
Maybe we're just that good.

547
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,857
I know because I built Ultron.

548
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,526
Oh. Well, that sucks.

549
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,715
Do you see, Avenger?

550
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:59,719
Rumors of the children's existence
already spread among the humans.

551
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,349
Superhuman variable
cannot be permitted.

552
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,060
The children
must be destroyed.

553
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,062
Hey, that's not fair!

554
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,938
James doesn't even
have any powers.

555
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,608
Scanning Avengers data files.

556
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:17,362
Identity match. James Rogers,
son of Steve Rogers,

557
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:21,949
AKA Captain America,
the most dangerous of all the Avengers.

558
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:25,370
He inspired them,
and like Captain America,

559
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,955
you, James,
will be the first to fall!

560
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,836
Not today, robot.

561
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,970
Barton.

562
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,697
Azari, Pym, run!
Go with Hawkeye.

563
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:01,989
Torunn, take Tony.

564
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,078
Scavengers, disappear!

565
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,759
Go!

566
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,305
There is no hope
for the Avengers.

567
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,312
Find them.

568
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,279
Go!

569
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:43,990
Move it, you two!

570
00:45:56,837 --> 00:46:01,340
(screaming)

571
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,929
Kinda cutting it
close there, gorgeous.

572
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,556
Better late than never.

573
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,773
I created Ultron
to be a force for peace,

574
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,191
for law and order.

575
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,526
But its programming evolved.

576
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:21,944
It began to believe the only way to

577
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,905
truly bring order to the world

578
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,573
was to control it.

579
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:26,949
That's when it turned on us.

580
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,118
That's why Ultron didn't kill you?

581
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,745
Because you're his daddy?

582
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,289
My armor was damaged
in the attack.

583
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,958
Cap told me to get
the kids to safety.

584
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,461
I couldn't get to you
in time, Francis.

585
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:43,299
Hawkeye's name is Francis?

586
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:44,926
Ow!

587
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,721
I thought Ultron had
already gotten to you.

588
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,973
Otherwise, you would have
come with the others.

589
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:58,981
I raised you all hopefully
as your parents would have wanted.

590
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,983
I owed it to them.

591
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,652
Ultron was my fault.

592
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,195
Why didn't my father help?

593
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:08,241
Thor left the Avengers
when his father Odin died.

594
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:12,912
He said Asgard was his
responsibility from then on, not Earth.

595
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,914
A few months after we crashed,

596
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,249
the Vision found us.

597
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,209
He survived
by staying intangible.

598
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:21,254
He became my eyes and ears
in the real world.

599
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,757
We kept track of Ultron's
capabilities and movements,

600
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,509
trying to find a way
to defeat him.

601
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:29,095
But I couldn't bear
the thought of losing you,

602
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,055
so I kept you hidden,

603
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,933
and I kept the truth
from you.

604
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,894
Until the Vision
told me you were alive,

605
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:40,940
I thought we were the only ones
to survive Ultron's attack.

606
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,276
I didn't know
your father escaped.

607
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,945
You weren't
the only ones, Tony.

608
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,947
Betty!

609
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,283
The Hulk survived too.

610
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,785
What's a "hulk"?

611
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:53,911
The Hulk is a monster.

612
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,705
That's what my dad said.

613
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:56,956
He used to tell me stories.

614
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,542
He said the Hulk was
the strongest one there was.

615
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,961
What, like a monster monster?

616
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,129
With fangs and stuff?

617
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,923
Francis is right.
the Hulk was a monster,

618
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:08,926
a creature of pure rage.

619
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:11,721
Is the Hulk strong enough
to defeat Ultron?

620
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,931
He won't help you, James.

621
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,141
He's too scared.

622
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,396
He's hidden from Ultron
all these years too.

623
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,689
Where?

624
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,983
Where he always goes:

625
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,234
the desert.

626
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,532
Can you help us
get out of the city?

627
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,660
Yeah, right.
Help the guy who created Ultron,

628
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,995
who got my dad killed?

629
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,664
What do you think my father
would have done, Stark?

630
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,167
Clint? He would have
punched me in the face,

631
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,668
then he would
have helped me.

632
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:46,964
Wow.
You really knew my dad.

633
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,968
We've had it for
a couple of years.

634
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,346
But the minute you power it up,
Ultron will know. He's--

635
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,972
He's wired in. I know.

636
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,016
But I know
how to wire him out.

637
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,314
We'll buy you
all the time we can.

638
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:22,249
You did a good job
with them, Tony.

639
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,918
I should have done better.

640
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:27,922
You're being too hard
on yourself.

641
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,599
Everything okay?

642
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,601
Yeah. It's-- yeah.

643
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,646
It's just-- I've never been
outside the city.

644
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,481
It's really big out here.

645
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,942
That's how we felt
when we went inside the city.

646
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,029
Why did you come back
for us at the Citadel,

647
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,447
after everything you said?

648
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:56,784
The scavengers look up
to me. They rely on me.

649
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,077
And it's only a matter of time

650
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,955
until Ultron wipes out
every single one of them.

651
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,833
So if you guys have
even the slightest shot

652
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:04,959
at taking down Ultron,

653
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,877
I've got to try.

654
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,796
Otherwise, what's the point?

655
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:13,009
Besides, anything to
impress a girl, right?

656
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,385
Girl?

657
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,429
Wait. You mean Torunn?

658
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,973
- Dude, she's like my sister.
- So, she's available?

659
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,933
No, she's not.

660
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:57,386
Ohm...

661
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,223
- Bruce.
- Wha--?

662
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,977
Oh, come on!
That's the Hulk?

663
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,979
The big scary monster?

664
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,647
I could beat him up.

665
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,566
No no no no no no no!

666
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:13,027
Get out!
Get out of here!

667
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:16,530
Please, for your own sakes,
you have to get away from me!

668
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,824
Nuts, anyone?

669
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,743
Bruce, it's me! It's--

670
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,411
Get out of here, Stark!

671
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,497
(panting)

672
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:25,915
Bruce,

673
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:29,627
it's okay. Breathe.

674
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,420
(breathing steadies)

675
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,005
Betty?

676
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,758
Well, he's sort of scary,

677
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:36,967
I guess.

678
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,177
Shut up, Pym.

679
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:41,013
Shh, it's okay.

680
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:44,100
Breathe. Let it go.

681
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,769
We don't want you
to get angry.

682
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:47,812
(Bruce sighs)

683
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:50,106
What happens
when he gets angry?

684
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:53,025
Anger makes
the Hulk come out.

685
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,614
You can't be here.
It's too dangerous.

686
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,866
The Hulk is too dangerous.

687
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:03,786
It's okay, Bruce.
We just had to get out of the city.

688
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,287
Can the Hulk defeat Ultron?

689
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,539
James!

690
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,291
The Hulk doesn't care
about Ultron, boy!

691
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,836
He just wants
to be left alone.

692
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,587
You are all in danger.

693
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:17,758
I have to stay here.
I have to keep the Hulk inside.

694
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:21,971
When the Hulk comes out,
bad things happen.

695
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,598
The Hulk won't help you,

696
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,392
and neither will I.

697
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,784
So where do you
think we'll go now?

698
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:44,952
Tony wants us to hide, but--

699
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:48,247
He's right. We have to run.

700
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:52,001
We have to hide.
We can't beat Ultron.

701
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,711
Yes, we can.

702
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:54,837
And we have to.

703
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,214
We can't hide anymore, Torunn.

704
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:00,009
If we don't stand up
to Ultron, who will?

705
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,429
If we don't protect people
like the scavengers, who will?

706
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,930
We have to make a stand.

707
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:08,434
The longer we wait
the more powerful Ultron becomes.

708
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,936
He'll never stop hunting us.

709
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,688
He'll never stop
coming after Tony.

710
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,690
We have to stop him.

711
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,944
We owe it to our parents.

712
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:21,572
We're all that's left
of their legacy.

713
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:24,575
The Hulk is the strongest one
there is, right?

714
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,619
Well, if the Hulk won't go to Ultron,

715
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,787
then we'll bring Ultron
to the Hulk.

716
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:32,625
Okay, Hawkeye said that Ultron is
wired into every one of his machines.

717
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,960
If we power up the ship
so Ultron can sense it,

718
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,587
he'll come running.

719
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,964
I think that's the most words
you've ever said in a row.

720
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:42,051
Okay, remember when
I called Bruce nuts?

721
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,135
You got him beat.

722
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,221
I know we can do this.

723
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,263
We can do it together.

724
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,307
No! I can't!

725
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:53,479
She'll be okay.
She just needs time.

726
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,982
Are you in?

727
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,656
Azari:
I hope you're right about this.

728
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,950
That makes two of us.

729
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,960
(powering up)

730
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,375
No!

731
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,212
James, what have you done?

732
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,965
What our parents would have.

733
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,926
Now, who wants
to go tell the Hulk?

734
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,846
You did what?!

735
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,222
Bruce, stop!

736
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,516
Should we,
you know, do something?

737
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,476
Dude, it was his plan.

738
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:33,954
Father, please help us.

739
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:37,124
I'm scared,
scared for my brothers,

740
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,835
for Tony, for Hawkeye.

741
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,962
They need me.

742
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:44,631
If you ever cared for me,

743
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,967
please help me now.

744
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:49,053
Help me save my family.

745
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,305
I'm begging you.

746
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,724
Lend me your strength.

747
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:56,143
(voice echoes)

748
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:59,146
(wind rumbles)

749
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,231
(wind fades)

750
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,594
Thank you, Father.

751
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,513
Thank you.

752
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:48,821
The Iron Avengers are tough,
but not invincible.

753
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,990
Go for exposed joints.
Try to surprise them,

754
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,409
trip up their programming.

755
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,953
Don't get locked down
to one opponent.

756
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:59,123
What about Ultron?

757
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:02,501
Ultron is a different story.

758
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:06,213
This plan seemed a lot better
when Torunn and the Hulk were involved.

759
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:10,926
Whether you know it or not,
you've prepared for this all your lives.

760
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:14,596
Aye, we did!
And today we meet our destinies!

761
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,225
She means that
in a good way, right?

762
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:20,436
Probably better
if we don't know.

763
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,148
Welcome back.

764
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,024
You know
I wouldn't miss a fight.

765
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,943
Verily.

766
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,529
(rumbling)

767
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,417
(all exclaiming)

768
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:49,798
(all screaming)

769
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:51,967
Torunn!

770
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,905
- (laser stinging)
- Pym: Hah! Hi-yah!

771
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,748
Azari:
Here they come!

772
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,834
James:
Get behind me!

773
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,089
Look out!

774
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,304
Yes!

775
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,227
Aw, come on!

776
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:43,245
Tony!

777
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,509
Pym:
James, is he okay?

778
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:04,141
- What are we gonna do?
- Pym, don't be scared. You can do this.

779
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:09,813
(yelling)

780
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:25,537
Are you really going to let them
just die out there, Bruce?

781
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:27,539
- (explosion)
- (pots shatter)

782
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,382
Now what?

783
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,885
Just hit him, Pym!

784
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:57,027
Sorry, robot.
I'm just too fast.

785
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:03,950
(growling)

786
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:20,425
Nice kitty.

787
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,919
Huh?

788
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,586
- (buzzing)
- (lasers zapping)

789
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:38,962
Agh! Agh!

790
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:41,548
Robot moths!

791
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:54,352
- James!
- Pym! Get to the Hulk!

792
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:56,438
Tony said
anger brings him out,

793
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:57,564
so make him angry.

794
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,778
What? Knock it off!
Angry? How?

795
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,863
I don't know. Insult him.

796
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,531
Make fun of his pants!

797
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:30,305
Mr. Hulk!

798
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,182
What's going on out there?

799
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,850
What's happening?

800
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:36,269
Sorry.
(zapping)

801
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,980
Ow! Stop! Agh!

802
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:41,024
- (zapping)
- (Bruce yelling)

803
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,363
(gasps)

804
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:49,658
- (zapping continues)
- Get away from me!

805
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,213
(muffled scream)

806
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:04,923
Pym, run!

807
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:06,758
(explosion)

808
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:16,434
(screaming)

809
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,937
(screaming echoes)

810
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,822
(Hulk yelling)

811
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,456
Incredible!

812
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,792
We're doing it!
We're gonna win!

813
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,964
Hulk smash!

814
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:02,480
Did you think
I had forgotten you, monster?

815
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:04,691
Ultron never forgets.

816
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:05,942
(Hulk growls)

817
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:07,903
(Hulk screaming)

818
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,991
You're not
the Black Panther!

819
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,204
I am!

820
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,464
(Hulk screaming)

821
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:31,903
Huh?

822
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:39,953
Ultron, we would
have word with thee.

823
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:47,794
- (Pym yelling)
- (lasers zapping)

824
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,212
(buzzing)

825
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:52,549
Both: Pym!

826
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:07,731
(screams)

827
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:22,537
Mr. Hulk,
you have to get up.

828
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:24,289
You have to help us, please!

829
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:42,432
Ultron killed our parents!
He's killing us!

830
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:44,392
And, and--

831
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,227
and you're scared of him.

832
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,563
Ultron's just a stupid robot

833
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:49,981
and he can beat you up.

834
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:51,900
And he said you were ugly.

835
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:53,193
He said you were a big wimp

836
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:55,361
and that he
was stronger than you!

837
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:59,115
(James screams)

838
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,452
Now ends the Avengers.

839
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:04,913
(Hulk growls)

840
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,166
(Hulk yelling)

841
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:12,712
- (Hulk smashing)
- (groans)

842
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:15,632
(Hulk continues smashing)

843
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:38,863
Hulk is strongest
there is!

844
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,949
- (Hulk's voice echoes)
- Uh-oh.

845
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:43,034
Uh-oh?
What do you mean, "uh-oh"?

846
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,496
(growling)

847
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:50,542
(Hulk yells)

848
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:57,215
Betty's voice:
Hulk.

849
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,818
Shrinking boy

850
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:20,905
no sting Hulk anymore!

851
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:24,492
Never again, I promise.

852
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:32,709
Hello, Betty.

853
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:35,295
Hello, Hulk.

854
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:40,925
Are you ready?

855
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,945
It's not over.

856
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:04,407
It might take a while,

857
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:06,951
but Ultron's systems
are designed to repair.

858
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,703
As long as there's
enough of him,

859
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:11,539
he can always
come back.

860
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:14,959
Then we have to take him
somewhere he can't come back!

861
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,127
Torunn!

862
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:23,968
James:
What are you doing?

863
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:25,720
Making sure my family is safe.

864
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:31,726
Torunn!

865
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:46,950
(ice cracking)

866
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:48,660
(yelling)

867
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:56,668
(gasping)

868
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:15,687
Thor:
Rest, my child.

869
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:19,023
Thee have earned it.

870
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,486
Father?

871
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:29,033
You have done me proud, Torunn.

872
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:31,995
In facing your mortality,

873
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:36,207
you learned the very same lesson
that Odin strove to teach me.

874
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:40,712
You learned what it meant
to be human.

875
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:44,007
That is why I left you
with the Avengers.

876
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:47,051
Because in all the gods
of Asgard,

877
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:51,055
none have the humanity
that make a true hero.

878
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,100
Come home, Torunn.

879
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:57,061
Come home to Asgard.

880
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,945
Home.

881
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,324
Oh, Father,

882
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:12,410
I can't believe
I'm saying this.

883
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:17,165
My home is
with my family on Earth.

884
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:20,752
I know, my daughter.

885
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:24,964
But know that the doors
to Asgard are always open to you,

886
01:12:24,965 --> 01:12:29,469
and when the time comes,
you will be welcomed.

887
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,026
Huh?

888
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:50,990
Dad says hi.

889
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:53,993
(all laugh)

890
01:12:57,915 --> 01:12:59,791
Solar power cells recharged.

891
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:03,669
As I was saying, the Savage Land
is quite lovely. I--

892
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:07,298
Oh my.
Have I missed something?

893
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:17,266
Man, it's been a long day.

894
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:19,727
It's not over, short stuff.

895
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:23,981
There's about 10,000 robots in Ultra City
that need arrows in their heads.

896
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:29,237
So, are you up
for a little avenging?

897
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:31,989
Avengers, assemble!
